/**

 * ({@code "cmd" | getline}) inherit Jawk's standard input, as POSIX requires,
 * when Jawk reads the standard input of the JVM — and that embedded executions
 * bound to a custom stream keep the child's standard input closed.
 * <p>
 * The inheritance can only be observed across a real process boundary, so the
 * inheriting cases run through
 * {@link AwkTestSupport#runCliInFreshJvm(String, String, String)}, which
 * spawns the CLI in a fresh JVM whose standard input is redirected from a
 * file.
