/**
 * A Jawk Extension.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface are eligible for insertion
 * into Jawk as an extension to the language. Extensions
 * appear within a Jawk script as function calls.
 * <p>
 * Extensions introduce native Java modules into the Jawk language.
 * This enables special services into Jawk, such as Sockets,
 * GUIs, databases, etc. natively into Jawk.
 * <p>
 * Extension functions can be used anywhere an AWK function,
 * builtin or user-defined, can be used.
 * <p>
 * Extensions introduce keywords into the Jawk parser.
 * Keywords are of type _EXTENSION_ tokens. As a result,
 * extension keywords cannot collide with other Jawk keywords,
 * variables, or function names. The extension mechanism
 * also guards against keyword collision with other extensions.
 * The Jawk lexer expects extension keywords to match as _ID_'s.
