 * Within Jawk, EndException is caught twice. The first
 * catch block executes when exit() is called within BEGIN
 * or action blocks. When invoked, the END blocks are
 * executed. The second catch block executes when exit() is
 * called within any of the END blocks. When invoked,
 * Jawk terminates with an exit code.
