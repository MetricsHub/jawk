/**
 * A placeholder for an object which has a reference to
 * a function address, but which may not be realized yet.
 * This is particularly important for forward-referenced
 * functions. For example:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * BEGIN { f(3) }
 * function f(x) { print x*x }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * f() is referred to prior to its definition. Therefore,
 * the getFunctionAddress() call within the BEGIN block
 * will not return a meaningful address. However, anytime
 * after f(x) is defined, getFunctionAddress() will return
 * the correct function address.
