/**
 * An item which blocks until something useful can be
 * done with the object. The BlockManager multiplexes
 * BlockObjects such that unblocking one
 * BlockObject causes the BlockManager to dispatch
 * the notifier tag result of the BlockObject.
 * <p>
 * BlockObjects are chained. The BlockManager
 * blocks on all chained BlockObjects until one
 * is unblocked.
 *
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must provide meaningful block()
 * and getNotifierTag() routines.
 *
 * <p>
 * BlockObjects do not actually perform the client
 * blocking. This is done by the BlockManager at the
 * AVM (interpreted) or compiled runtime environment.
 * The AVM/compiled environments make special provision
 * to return the head block object to the BlockManager
 * (within _EXTENSION_ keyword processing).
